# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals

My goal is to try to understand why some bike stations are full of bycicles and why some are empty in the city of Vancouver, BC. 

## Process

Utilize APIs to retrieve data from websites containing information about bike-sharing services in Vancouver, as well as diverse Points of Interest (POI) from platforms such as Yelp and FourSquare.


## Results

As I stated in the Notebook, in my assessment, Yelp has provided me with more valuable data, encompassing essential aspects like reviews, distance, price, and rating, all of which I am inclined to incorporate into my case study.

Simultaneously, handling the data extracted from Yelp proved to be more straightforward than dealing with information from Foursquare.

However, one drawback is the restrictive data retrieval limit imposed by Yelp, necessitating the use of a secondary email address to overcome this limitation.


## Challenges 

Foremost in the challenges I encountered was the retrieval of information through APIs. Following that, managing JSON data and navigating nested information within columns posed its own set of complexities. Lastly, I observed that the data obtained initially wasn't as comprehensive, as we can appreciate with a R2 = 0.010, and I discovered more valuable datasets, such as the one from Mobi Bikes (the bike-sharing company in Vancouver). This dataset includes detailed information about each trip, such as trip distance, date and time, user type, start and end stations, and more.

## Future Goals

As previously stated, leveraging the datasets from Mobi can enhance our results and provide a more insightful understanding of the city's bike-sharing system behavior.
